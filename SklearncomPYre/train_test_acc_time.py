    The purpose of this function is to compare different sklearn regressors or classifiers in terms 
    of training and test accuracies, and the time it takes to fit and predict. 
    The function inputs are dictionary of models, input train samples `Xtrain`(input features), 
    input test samples `Xtest`, target train values `ytrain` and target test values `ytest` 
    (continuous or categorical).
    
    The function outputs a beautiful dataframe with training & test scores, 
    model variance, and the time it takes to fit and predict using different models.  

  Inputs:

    - Dictionary of ML classifiers or regressors.
    - X train set: `Array-like `
    - Y train set: `Array-like`
    - X test set: `Array-like `
    - Y test set: `Array-like`

  Outputs:

    Dataframe with 7 columns: 
    - regressor or classifier name 
    - training accuracy 
    - test accuracy 
    - model variance 
    - time it takes to fit 
    - time it takes to predict 
    - total time 
 
     The dataframe will be sorted by test score in descending order.
